## 📋 Next Steps Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
1. **Resolve TensorFlow.js compatibility issues**
2. **Set up Supabase database using provided schema**
3. **Integrate trained model files into app bundle**

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 1)
1. **Complete ProfileScreen and ReportOutageScreen**
2. **Implement user authentication flow**
3. **Set up location services and permissions**

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 2)
1. **Test ML model predictions end-to-end**
2. **Verify KPLC scraping and notifications**
3. **Complete app testing and bug fixes**

### Phase 4: Polish & Deploy (Week 3)
